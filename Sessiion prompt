AI Awarenes Session for Students, Build the web App (Room Rent Manger) using Coding Agent IDE , will develop fronend and Backend and DBschema just using prompt, 
it should not take more than hour, then compare how much time it takes if you use softwawrae developer, architectec and tester , how many resources needs, deployemnt challenges.
Next session how to install Coding Agent IDE in their laptop, then list 25 booking realtes Apps, ask them to pick one , allow teh students doing by them and guide in 1-1 so that
every one will have booking app. after thet new sesion will convert their windows into WSL Linux Debian environment as real software developemnt needs Linux platform, and install 
qwen cli asking do the same app in WSL environmet using qwen CLI AI coding agent tools , so that student will get expeosure on linux platform , then next session push the code to 
github repostitory, nefore that craete each students to craete githu repo and repository with readme file, then clone it in the WSL system push the code. also push teh prompt. 
so fare all teh developemts done by teh AI coding agents tools. next session students to understand  the architecture starting from backend, DB schema, API building in backend 
and creating the frontend and integarting and up and running using Grok steps by steps, studensts has to follow to crate project layout an dcopy past teh code and execute and 
bring teh error and get resolutions by Grok, push teh changes to WSL do teh same iteratuions make proper  app bboking ap to up and running,  this session they will ened to end
hands on. next sessio how to craeet UI/UX design for boooing app for good looking and more intractive and proper navigations needs to build using Google stitch, then craete teh 
backend and DB schem using teh coding agen with qwen cli, make it sucessed, nect make itsucessed with AI studio, nect make with AI antigravity. this session am planning, 
come up weekly panning every 2 to 3 hours sessions. fater that we will prompt engineering
