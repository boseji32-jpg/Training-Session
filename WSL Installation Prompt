"Create a detailed, step-by-step guide for a SysAdmin class on installing and configuring Debian using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

The guide must be structured to support both modern Windows 10/11 installations (using the wsl --install command) and older Windows 10 versions (requiring a full manual configuration).

Crucially, ensure the guide includes explicit, separate steps for enabling the Virtual Machine Platform feature and the WSL Feature to ensure Docker compatibility is established from the beginning.

In a dedicated troubleshooting section, address common student mistakes and specific errors, including:

The Error 0x80370114 related to CPU virtualization being disabled in the BIOS.

Missing kernel component errors.

'wsl' is not recognized errors on older OS builds.

Finally, include essential post-installation steps covering: system updates, checking the default WSL version, and key developer integration points like accessing Windows files from Linux (/mnt/c) and accessing Linux services from the Windows browser via localhost."
